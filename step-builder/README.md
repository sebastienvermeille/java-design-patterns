Step Builder - Design pattern
==========================================

## Pro
* Provide fluent assistance to developer (each steps of the construct of an object is guided)
* No longer forget mandatory properties (compile time detection)

## Cons
* More complicated to write and maintain by hand. It is highly suggested to use a code generator for that purpose. (i.e.: 
  [stepbuilder-codegen](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16792-stepbuilder-codegen))
